Tip calculator using React + Vite.
Style => Tailwind CSS
Created custom hook to reutilize it across multiple components and have a better organized code.
Improved performance by making usage of useMemo so functions are only rendered when a dependency changes, in the case of this app, when the value of the order or the tip changes.
